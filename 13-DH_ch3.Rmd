## PURPOSE

### Research Question

> How is weight loss associationed with exercise frequency and food intake? 


### Data Description

Suppose you conducted a study examining the relationship between food consumption and weight loss among people enrolled (`n` = 10) in a month-long healthy living class.

**Dependent Variable (DV)**

* `loss` average weight loss in hundreds of grams per week


**Independent Variables (IVs)**

* `exer` average weekly hours of exercise

* `diet` average daily food consumption (in 100s of calories about the recommended minimum of 1,000 calories required to maintain good health)

* `meta` metabolic rate

## REGRESSION ANALYSIS

### Fit the models

* The dependent variable (DV) is weight loss ($Y$)
* The independent variables (IVs) are exercise and diet ($X$)

```{r}
fit_lm_exer <- lm(loss ~ exer,
                  data = df_loss)

fit_lm_diet <- lm(loss ~ diet,
                  data = df_loss)

fit_lm_both <- lm(loss ~ exer + diet,
                  data = df_loss)

fit_lm_three<- lm(loss ~ exer + diet + meta,
                  data = df_loss)
```




### Equations

$$

\hat{loss} = 7.14 + 0.07(food) \\
\hat{loss} = 6 + 2(exercise) -0.5(food) \\

$$
\hat{loss} = 6 + 2(exercise) -0.5(food)
$$

Suppose an examination of the literature on diet, exercise, and weight loss led you to the following conclusions: 

1. People who eat the **minimum number of calories** to maintain good health and who **do not exercise** at all will lose how much?


```{r}
fit_lm_both %>% 
  emmeans::emmeans(~ exer + diet,
                   at = list(exer = 0,
                             diet = 0))

```

> The estimated marginal mean weight loss is 600 grams per week among thoes who eat the minimum number of calories to maintain good health and who do not exercise at, *b* = 6.00, 95% *CI* = [2.99, 9.01].



2. If food intake is held constant, then **each 1 hour of average daily exercise** leads to how much more weight loss?

```{r}
fit_lm_both %>% 
  emmeans::emmeans(~ exer + diet,
                   at = list(exer = 0:4))

```


> Holding food consumption constant, each additional hour of daily exercise is associated with 200 grams additional weight lost per week, *b* = 2.00, 95% *CI* = [1.21, 2.79].




3. If exercise is held constant, then **each one unit of food intake per day** (i.e., 100 calories) above the minimum to maintain good health translates to much weight gain?

```{r}
fit_lm_both %>% 
  emmeans::emmeans(~ diet,
                   at = list(diet = 0:4))

```

> Holding exercise constant, each additional 100 calories of food consumed daily is associated with 50 grams weight gained per week, *b* = -0.50, 95% *CI* = [1.21, 2.79]. 



4. If a person exercises 2 hours per week and eats 600 more calories than the minimum, how much weight would they loose weekly on average?


```{r}
fit_lm_both %>% 
  emmeans::emmeans(~ exer + diet,
                   at = list(exer = 2,
                             diet = 6))
```


> On average, 700 grams were lost per week amonth participants who exrcised 2 hours a week and consumed 6,600 more calories, 95% *CI* [572, 828].
