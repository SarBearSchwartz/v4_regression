## PURPOSE

### Research Question

> How is weight loss associationed with exercise frequency and food intake? 


### Data Description

Suppose you conducted a study examining the relationship between food consumption and weight loss among people enrolled (`n` = 10) in a month-long healthy living class.

#### Variables

**Dependent Variable (DV)**

* `loss` average weight loss in hundreds of grams per week


**Independent Variables (IVs)**

* `exer` average weekly hours of exercise

* `diet` average daily food consumption (in 100s of calories about the recommended minimum of 1,000 calories required to maintain good health)

* `meta` metabolic rate

* `sex` dichotomous variable with 2 codes




Manually enter the data set provided on page 44 in Table 3.1

## EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS

### Descriptive Statistics

#### Univariate

```{r}
df_loss %>% 
  dplyr::select("Sex" = sex) %>% 
  apaSupp::tab_freq(caption = "Summary of Categorical Measures")
```



```{r}
df_loss %>% 
  dplyr::select("Exercise Frequency" = exer,
                "Food Intake" = diet,
                "Metabolic Rate" = meta,
                "Weight Loss" = loss) %>% 
  apaSupp::tab_desc(caption = "Summary for Continuous Measures") %>% 
  flextable::hline(i = 3)
```




```{r}
df_loss %>% 
  dplyr::select(sex,
                "Weight Loss" = loss,
                "Exercise Frequency" = exer,
                "Food Intake" = diet,
                "Metabolic Rate" = meta) %>% 
  apaSupp::table1_apa(caption = "Descriptive of Continuous Measures by Sex",
                      split = sex) %>% 
  flextable::bg(i = 1:3, j = 3, bg = "lightblue") %>% 
  flextable::bg(i = 1:3, j = 4, bg = "lightpink")
```


#### Bivariate



```{block type='rmdimportant', echo=TRUE}
Pearson's correlation is only appropriate for TWO CONTINUOUS variables.  The exception is when 1 variable is continuous and the other has exactly 2 levels.  In this case, the binary variable needs to be converted to two numbers (numeric not factor) and the value is called the **Point-Biserial Correlation** ($r_{pb}$).
```

TAble highlighting below:

* YELLOW: un-adjusted correlation between each IV and the DV, at least some of them will usually be significant

* ORANGE: pairwise correlations between each pair of IVs...if any are moderately strong, then we need to be concerned about potential multicolinearity and check the variance inflation factors (VIF).


```{r}
df_loss %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(sex = as.numeric(sex == "Female")) %>% 
  dplyr::select("Weight Loss" = loss,

## REGRESSION ANALYSIS

This data was previously analyzed by regressing weight loss on the main effects of the continuous independent measures (See D & H Ch2 a).


### Add 2-level Categorical Predictor

```{r}
fit_loss_wsex <- lm(loss ~ exer + diet + meta + sex,
                    data = df_loss)

summary(fit_loss_wsex)
```



```{r}
apaSupp::tab_lm(fit_loss_wsex)
```

```{r}
apaSupp::tab_lm(fit_loss_wsex, 
                fit = c("r.squared", "adj.r.squared",
                        "statistic", "df", "df.residual", "p.value"),
                var_labels = c("exer" = "Exercise Freq",
                               "diet" = "Food Intake",
                               "meta" = "Metabolic Rate",
                               "sex"  = "Sex"),
                caption = "Parameter Estimtates for Weight Loss Regressed Exercise Frequency, Food Intake, and Sex",
                d = 3) %>% 
  flextable::bg(i = 5:7, bg = "yellow")
```




```{block type='rmdimportant', echo=TRUE}
Estimated Regression Coefficients show **RELATIONSHIPS**

* Continuous IV: slope, rise per run
* Categorical IV: difference in group means
```

> INTERPRETATION: After adjusting or correcting for difference in exercise frequency, food intake, and metobalic rate, females lost nearly 404 g/wk less on average than their male counterparts although this was not a statistically significant difference, *b* = -0.40, *SE* = 0.87, *p* = .662.

> INTERPRETATION: 
>
> Of these four factors, the onse most under a person's control (food intake and exercise) uniquely explain about 45.7% of the varaince in weight loss, holding constant the ones less under personal control (sex and metabolism).  
>
> We can also say the factors more under personal control explain about 86.9% of the variance in weight loss that remains after accounting for the factors less under control.












### Standardized Regression Coefficients

```{block type='rmdimportant', echo=TRUE}
Standardized regression coefficients for **CATEGORICAL** predictors (IVs) is **DISCOURAGED!**
