## PURPOSE

### Background

Fatalism has been studied as a health belief since 1980. Several studies have found a positive association between fatalism and depression. Researchers have suggested that fatalism can make people more vulnerable to depression. 

If you have pathological Simplicity thinking, you can't think gray about nearly anything. You see everything in life as a black-and-white film. You think in such extremes, so you end up feeling in these extremes as well.

### Research Question

> Is there a relationship between depression and beliefs (simplicity and fatalism)? 
>
> More so, if we control for the assumed association between fatalism and depression, does simplistic beliefs play an additional role?

* The dependent variable (DV) is depression score ($Y$)
* The independent variables (IVs) are 2 beliefs, simplicity and fatalism ($X_1$, $X_2$)

### Methods

A sample of 82 psychiatric patients hospitalized for depression completed the Beck Depression Inventory by self-report.  Their beliefs in simplicity (*black and white thinking*) and fatalism (*fate controls everything*) were also self-reported and scored. 

To assess the potential relationship between both these beliefs and depressive symptoms, first Pearson correlations were computed between pairs of all three measures.  Then unadjusted, simple linear regression models for each belief score separately were compared to the multiple linear regression including both beliefs. Multiple linear regression was used to further investigate the hypothesized association between simplicity and depression after controlling for the previously documented correlation between fatalism and depression. Variance inflation factors (*VIF*) were computed to assess potential concern regarding colinearity between the two beliefs.


### Results

A summary of the participant measures is provided in Table 1.  Notably, the distribution of simplicity beliefs exhibited a high degree of positive skewness, while depressive symptoms was less positively skewed (*see supplemental materials*).    

Depressive Symptoms were positively correlated with both fatalism beliefs (*r* = .660) and simplicity beliefs (*r* = .640). A similar degree of correlation was manifest between the two types of belief (*r* = .630).

The unadjusted models are presented in Table 2.  The first model replicated previous studies, as fatalism beliefs exhibited a strong and significant association with depressive symptoms, *b* = 0.66, *SE* = 0.08, *p* < .001, $R^2$ = .43. The second model showed a similar association between simplicity beliefs and depressive symptoms, *b* = 0.64, *SE* = 0.09, *p* < .001, $R^2$ = .41.

Table 3 details the final model which revealed that after accounting for fatalism's role, simplicity beliefs accounted for 15% of the remaining variance in depressive symptoms, $\eta_p^2$ = .153. Over half of the total variance in depressive symptoms may be attributed to both beliefs together, $R_{adj}^2$ = .51. No concern was raised regarding multicolinearity, thus each belief exhibited a distinct association with depression symptom. Fatalism belief did expressed a slightly stronger association, *b* = 0.42, *SE* = 0.10, *p* < .001, $\eta^2$ = .105, compared to simplicity beliefs, *b* = 0.38, *SE* = 0.10, *p* < .001, $\eta^2$ = .087.
